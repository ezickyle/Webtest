   <p className='ZEE'> This website is all about 'ME' and my passion is to serve clients, this website is not  for me to brag about, but to show you my capabilities.
   before judging let's keep in mind that every person has their own specialty or specialization in different fields. Information technology is not my main pursued degree, but when
   it comes to latest technology I assure you that I'am always updated. although choosing freelancing as a job is a new experience for me. It dosen't really affect any work that you would request.
   I'am easy to teach and good at doing stuff by myself.</p>
